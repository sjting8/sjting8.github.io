### Programming Experience?
I'm currently a second-year CS Major in Warren. I've had exposure to programming/computer science throughout my whole life but never really delved deep into a specific field, so I'm excited to start looking into specializations. I have a _little_ experience with **React/Typescript** and I have some exposure to **Django** (Django REST Framework) which may or may not help me in this course. In terms of frontend development, I'm also familiar with `mui`.
> C++ is my favorite language, though as written in [this](README.md).
### Who am I outside of programming?
I love Pillow Pets.
